# Horseman, the headless CMS

Horseman is a headless CMS thats powered by Cloudflare KV and the Cache API.

## Initalization of Horseman
Before you can create accounts and use Horseman, you need to visit your Workers URL and `/v1/__meta/init`. This creates all the schemas for Horseman to function.

##  Acknowledgements
Horseman was created by Cerulean, all code (except ./lib/tsndr_router.js) is copyright of Connor Vince.
