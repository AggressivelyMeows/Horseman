# üê¥ Horseman, the headless CMS

Horseman is a headless CMS thats powered by Cloudflare KV and the Cache API. Using DurableObjects to ensure data indexes are valid and up to date.

You can find a public Horseman instance on my website, here: https://horseman.ceru.dev/

API documentation can be found here: https://horseman.stoplight.io/docs/horseman/abe38a2fb9c9d-list-models

## üî• Todo / Feature list

- Pub/Sub channels for getting up to date information on your Objects.
- Better documentation

## ü§î Why?
Horseman was created when I wanted to make a news feed for Wordful. Looking at other offerings, I wished for something simple, yet quick. After some quick discussions, I realised I could make my own headless CMS by utilising Cloudflare's global KV. This makes Horseman no less than 50ms from anyone around the world.

## üîß Setting up
What you'll need:
- A machine with Wrangler 2
- A paid Workers subscription ($5 a month, used for the password hashing Worker)
- A setup, working password hashing Worker: (https://github.com/AggressivelyMeows/password-hashing)
- Please read the README to get the Worker setup correctly.

#### Step 1 - Config
Open wrangler.toml and edit the lines described by the comments. Make sure to follow them precicely otherwise Horseman will not work.

#### Step 2 - Publish the Worker
Run `npx wrangler publish` to publish Horseman to your Cloudflare account. Once done, you will neekd to visit `/v1/__meta/init` to start the database. This step is *required* for Horseman to know whats going on.
